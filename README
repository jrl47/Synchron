This is my former attempt at a game that would force players to control two players at once.
Based on the idea that people can play the piano perfectly fine after practice, but only after surpassing a certain level of initial investment, I wanted to make a game that would create a learning curve that would be highly enjoyable to explore, a la Super Hexagon.
Eventually abandoned because I didn't really feel like the platformer genre was the best one for me to explore, but I had a lot of fun with it. May revisit eventually.
